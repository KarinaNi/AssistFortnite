Assist for Fortnite App

To build the app, need an android emulator/device with the expo app installed.
In command line, you would need to have node js and npm install.

To build this, go to command line, type any of the following commands and press enter.
npm start

After the command, there would be a localhost website on the web browser open. 
After running the javascript bundle, the app would either open up on the emulator, if you are using that option or 
if you have a real android phone connected, you could go to the expo app and scan and have the app show up there.
